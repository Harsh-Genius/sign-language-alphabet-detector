Real-Time Sign Language Alphabet Detection
This project is a real-time sign language alphabet detection system that utilizes computer vision and machine learning to bridge communication between deaf/mute individuals and those unfamiliar with sign language. The system captures hand gestures through a web camera, processes them, and displays the corresponding detected alphabet on the screen.

Features:
Real-Time Detection: Hand gestures are recognized in real-time, providing immediate feedback.
Machine Learning Model: Trained on a dataset to accurately classify gestures into the English alphabet.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive display of detected alphabets for seamless communication.
Tech Stack: Built using Python, Visual Studio Code, and machine learning frameworks.
Use Case:
This project aims to assist in the communication between individuals who use sign language and those who do not, making interactions more inclusive and accessible.

Installation & Usage:
Instructions on how to set up and run the project locally are provided in the repository.
